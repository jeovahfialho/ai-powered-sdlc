# Phase 1: Concept Ideation

## Objective:
Assist in generating ideas for notifications.

## Demo:
Utilizing an AI tool for brainstorming types of notifications, such as promotions, game availability, reward points, etc.

## Implementation Steps

1. **AI Brainstorming Tool**:
   - We will use an NLP model to generate notification ideas based on inputs provided by the Product Owner.
   - Examples of inputs can include: "notifications for promotions", "game availability", "reward points".

2. **Practical Example**:
   - Develop a script that uses GPT-4 to generate notification suggestions.

### Example Implementation

Let's create a simple script in Python that uses GPT-4 to generate notification ideas. This script will simulate interaction with the Product Owner, Sarah, to assist in ideation.

#### Example Script:

```python
import openai

# Configure the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

def generate_notification_ideas(input_text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Generate ideas for notifications about {input_text}:",
        max_tokens=150,
        n=5,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return response.choices

# Inputs for the brainstorming tool
inputs = [
    "promotions",
    "game availability",
    "reward points"
]

for input_text in inputs:
    ideas = generate_notification_ideas(input_text)
    print(f"Ideas for notifications about {input_text}:")
    for i, idea in enumerate(ideas):
        print(f"{i+1}. {idea.text.strip()}")
    print("
")
```

## Alternative AI Options for Concept Ideation Phase

1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
   - **Objective:** Use BERT to understand the context of the provided ideas and generate relevant notifications.
   - **Advantage:** BERT can better capture the contextual meaning of words and phrases, resulting in more accurate suggestions.

2. **GPT-3/GPT-4**
   - **Objective:** Utilize GPT-3/GPT-4 for creative and relevant text generation based on inputs.
   - **Advantage:** High capacity to generate human-like text and understand complex prompts.

3. **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**
   - **Objective:** Use the T5 model to convert idea descriptions into detailed notifications.
   - **Advantage:** Flexible model that can be trained on various NLP tasks, including text generation.

4. **OpenAI Codex**
   - **Objective:** Use Codex to generate code snippets or pseudocode to help create interactive notifications.
   - **Advantage:** Can directly generate implementable code for system components.

## Practical Description and Business Aspects

### Reduction in Development Time
- **Goal:** Reduce product development timelines by 70%.
- **Practical Impact:** If the average development time for a new feature is 6 months, AI implementation can reduce this to approximately 1.8 months.
- **Statistics:** Studies show that task automation can reduce development time by up to 50%, while human-AI collaboration can further reduce it by 20%.

### Increase in First-Time-Right Delivery
- **Goal:** Increase first-time-right delivery of features by 50%.
- **Practical Impact:** If currently 40% of features are right the first time, AI implementation can increase this to 60%.
- **Statistics:** Using AI for requirements analysis and ambiguity detection can reduce error rates by up to 50%.

### Improved Collaboration
- **Goal:** Enhance collaboration between different roles in the development process.
- **Practical Impact:** AI tools that facilitate communication and documentation can reduce conflicts and misunderstandings, increasing team efficiency.
- **Statistics:** Companies that adopt AI collaboration tools report a 30% increase in team efficiency.

### Increase in Product Launches
- **Goal:** Drive a 30% increase in successful product launches per year.
- **Practical Impact:** If 10 products are currently launched per year, AI implementation can increase this number to 13.
- **Statistics:** Automation of repetitive tasks and improvement in requirements accuracy can increase product launch capacity by up to 30%.

## Business Value and ROI Potential

### Business Value
- **Cost Reduction:** Reducing development time lowers operational costs.
- **Revenue Increase:** Faster and more accurate product launches increase customer satisfaction and revenue.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Improved internal communication and collaboration.

### ROI Potential
- **ROI Calculation:** If the annual development cost is $1,000,000, a 70% reduction in development time can save approximately $700,000. If a 30% increase in product launches generates an additional $300,000 in revenue, the potential ROI is $1,000,000 minus the cost of AI implementation.
- **Payback Period:** With annual savings of $700,000 and an initial implementation cost of $300,000, the payback period would be less than a year.

## Next Steps
