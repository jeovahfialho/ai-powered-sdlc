# Phase 3: Design Phase

## 1. AI-suggested UI/UX Wireframes

**Objective**:
Use AI to suggest different styles of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for app notifications.

**Approach**:
AI helps create wireframes, which are basic interface sketches. Design tools powered by AI, such as Microsoft's Sketch2Code, Uizard, or GPT-based solutions, can generate initial design suggestions.

**Expectations**:
- **Diversity of Styles**: Generate multiple notification styles like banners, pop-ups, alerts, and notification icons.
- **Consistency and Usability**: Suggestions should follow design principles ensuring good user experience, including clarity, accessibility, and consistency with the existing interface.
- **Interactivity**: Some AI tools can suggest interactive wireframes simulating app navigation.

**Steps**:
1. **Describe Different Notification Types**:
   - Example: Push notifications, in-app notifications, email alerts.

2. **Generate Wireframes with AI Tools**:
   - Use GPT-3.5 to generate detailed wireframe descriptions.
   - Convert descriptions into sketches using Sketch2Code or Uizard.

3. **Review and Select Suggestions**:
   - Review AI suggestions, selecting those best aligning with the appâ€™s usability and design goals.

## Exemplifying the Process

**1. AI-suggested Wireframes**:

- **Step 1**: Describe Different Notification Types:
  - Push notifications
  - In-app notifications
  - Email alerts

- **Step 2**: Use GPT-3.5 to Generate Detailed Wireframe Descriptions:
  ```python
  import openai

  # Configure the OpenAI API key
  openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

  # Example user stories
  user_stories = [
      "As a casino player, I want to receive notifications about the Slot Showdown promotion so that I can participate in the competition and have a chance to win exciting prizes while playing my favorite slots.",
      "As a casino patron, I want to receive notifications about Happy Hour promotions at the casino so that I can take advantage of special offers on drinks and games and increase my chances of winning big.",
      "As a casino customer, I want to receive notifications about special promotions like Blackjack Blitz so that I can participate and potentially win cash prizes and bonus chips by playing against the dealer."
  ]

  def generate_notification_descriptions(user_stories):
      descriptions = []
      for story in user_stories:
          response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
              model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
              messages=[
                  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                  {"role": "user", "content": f"Generate a detailed notification description for the following user story: {story}"}
              ],
              max_tokens=150,
              n=1,
              temperature=0.7,
          )
          descriptions.append(response.choices[0].message['content'].strip())
      return descriptions

  notification_descriptions = generate_notification_descriptions(user_stories)

  # Save descriptions to a file
  with open('notification_descriptions.txt', 'w') as f:
      for description in notification_descriptions:
          f.write(description + "\n\n")

  print("Generated Notification Descriptions:")
  for description in notification_descriptions:
      print(description)
```
