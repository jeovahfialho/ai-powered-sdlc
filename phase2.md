# Phase 2: Requirements Gathering

## Objective:
Generate user stories and acceptance criteria based on the ideas generated in the Concept Ideation phase.

## Demo:
Utilizing an AI tool to automatically generate requirement documents from the brainstorming ideas, including user stories and acceptance criteria.

## Implementation Steps

1. **AI Requirement Generation Tool**:
   - Use an NLP model to convert the ideas generated in Phase 1 into detailed user stories and acceptance criteria.
   - Parse the text ideas and transform them into structured requirements.

2. **Practical Example**:
   - Develop a script that uses GPT-4 to generate user stories and acceptance criteria based on the notification ideas from Phase 1.

### Example Implementation

Let's create a script in Python that uses GPT-4 to generate user stories and acceptance criteria based on the previously generated notification ideas.

#### Example Script:

```python
import openai

# Configure the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

def generate_user_stories_and_criteria(notification_ideas):
    stories_and_criteria = []
    
    for idea in notification_ideas:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            prompt=f"Generate a user story and acceptance criteria for the following casino notification idea: {idea}",
            max_tokens=150,
            n=1,
            temperature=0.7,
        )
        stories_and_criteria.append(response.choices[0].text.strip())
    
    return stories_and_criteria

# Example input from Phase 1
notification_ideas = [
    "Get ready to spin and win with our exclusive Slot Showdown promotion! Play your favorite slots and compete for a chance to win exciting prizes every hour.",
    "Join us for Happy Hour at the casino and enjoy special promotions on drinks and games all night long! Cheers to winning big!",

stories_and_criteria = generate_user_stories_and_criteria(notification_ideas)

print("Generated User Stories and Acceptance Criteria:")
for i, sc in enumerate(stories_and_criteria):
    print(f"{i+1}. {sc}")
```
