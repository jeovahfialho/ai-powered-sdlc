# Phase 4: Technical Planning

**Objective**:
Use AI tools to generate technical architecture diagrams for implementing real-time notifications in the app.

**Approach**:
AI can assist in creating detailed technical plans and architecture diagrams. For this phase, we will utilize the user story and acceptance criteria to generate a comprehensive diagram using an AI tool like Eraser Diagram GPT.

**Expectations**:
- **Detailed Architecture**: The AI-generated diagram should cover all necessary components, including data flow, key modules, and interactions between different parts of the system.
- **Clarity and Accuracy**: Ensure the generated diagram is clear and accurately represents the technical requirements outlined in the user story and acceptance criteria.
- **Customization**: Be ready to make manual adjustments to the diagram if needed to fit specific project requirements.

## Steps

1. **Select a User Story and Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Example: "As a casino player, I want to receive notifications about the Slot Showdown promotion so that I can participate in the competition and have a chance to win exciting prizes while playing my favorite slots."
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     1. The notification about the Slot Showdown promotion should be sent to registered casino players every hour during the duration of the competition.
     2. The notification should include details about the promotion, such as the name "Slot Showdown," the opportunity to win exciting prizes, and the requirement to play favorite slots to participate.
     3. The notification should provide a clear call-to-action, encouraging players to join the competition and start playing their favorite slots.
     4. Players should be able to opt-out of receiving notifications about the Slot Showdown promotion.

2. **Generate the Technical Diagram**:
   - Use the selected user story and acceptance criteria.
   - Go to [Eraser Diagram GPT](https://www.eraser.io/diagramgpt).
   - Input the user story and acceptance criteria to generate the architecture diagram.

3. **Review and Adjust the Diagram**:
   - Ensure the generated diagram accurately represents the technical requirements.
   - Make any necessary adjustments to fit the projectâ€™s needs.
